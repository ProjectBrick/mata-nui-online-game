    		<font face="verdana, helvetica" size="1">Sometimes the mysteries of Mata Nui can be difficult to unravel. That's why the Bionicle team has put together some hints to help you find your way around the island. Click on the section where you're having trouble and you'll see a list of questions. If you find the question that applies to your problem, click on it. If you click once you'll receive a hint, click again and you may receive another hint. Each question may have several tips to help you along. Good luck!<br><br>

<b>On the Beach</b><br>
  Q. What&#39;s that big canister doing there?<br>
  - Looks like somebody came out of it and walked away.<br>
  - Maybe you should follow the footprints?<br>
  - This is where Tahu arrived on Mata Nui. He headed towards the Burnt Forest. If you have the Storybook, you can see what happened next...<br>
<br>
  Q. How can I get into the big stone face on the beach?<br>
  - Hmm, it looks like you should be able to get in there, doesn&#39;t it?<br>
  - But you can&#39;t. Not right now, at any rate... the stone faces are a great mystery.<br>
<br>
  Q. What was that strange movie with all the stones falling from the sky?<br>
  - That was the Legend of Mata Nui, which is told using stones across the island.<br>
  - Perhaps one of the Turaga can tell you more.<br>
  - You can also learn more about the Legend on one of the Bionicle CD-ROMs.<br>
<br>
  Q. What is the green gem on the hook for, the one at the edge of the cliff?<br>
  - Have you tried clicking on the gem?<br>
  - Have you tried clicking on the pedestal underneath the hook?<br>
  - There is someone in the village of Ga-Koro who knows more about these things.<br>
  - The green gem is a telescope of sorts, that lets you see the starry sky above Mata Nui.<br>
  - The pedestal shows scenes from the prophecies kept by the Turaga, and each scene is connected to a certain constellation in the sky.<br>
  - &#34;When the Red Star is exactly where it is shown in one of the pictures, then a prophecy may come true.&#34;<br>
<br>
  Q. There&#39;s someone here with a boat, waving at me and asking me for help!<br>
  - Maybe you should talk to her.<br>
  - Maybe you should agree to help her?<br>
  - If you agree to help Maku, you will be journey to Ga-Koro automatically. You might want to hear about what happened first, though.<br>
<br>


<b>Ta-Koro</b><br>
  Q. How do I get across the big lava pit?<br>
  - That&#39;s the village of Ta-Koro over there. The guards and other travelers must have some way of getting back inside.<br>
  - You might want to check around the gate area, where the guards are patrolling.<br>
  - There&#39;s a staircase on one side of the archway where the guards are.<br>
  - In the guardhouse up the stairs, you can talk to Jala, Captain of the Guard. But there&#39;s another room behind him.<br>
  - In the room behind Jala, click on the big machine and watch it work.<br>
<br>
  Q. Why can&#39;t I go into the rooms in the back?<br>
  - Those are private dwellings of the Ta-Koro Tohunga. I don&#39;t think they&#39;d want you in there.<br>
  - You might want to talk to Vakama, Turaga of Ta-Koro, for more information.<br>
  - The Tohunga of Ta-Koro don&#39;t seem to like you for some reason!<br>
<br>
  Q. Why can&#39;t I use the cablecar at the top of the cliff stairs?<br>
  - It&#39;s broken.<br>
<br>
  Q. I&#39;m lost in the forest.<br>
  - Forests are dark and confusing places, but maybe you can keep track of where you&#39;re going.<br>
  - You don&#39;t have anything with you that you could use, but there are plenty of trees around.<br>
  - If you click on a tree, you&#39;ll make a marking there.<br>
  - Use the markings to keep track of which paths you&#39;ve already gone down. Eventually you&#39;ll find your way out.<br>
<br>
  Q. What is there to find in the forest?<br>
  - Lots and lots of blackened trees.<br>
  - You might run across someone else wandering in there.<br>
  - Kapura is practicing in the forest. There&#39;s nothing else to find there for now.<br>
<br>


<b>Ga-Koro</b><br>
  Q. The gate is closed, how do I get in?<br>
  - This gate looks kind of complicated. Maybe there&#39;s some way to open it from outside?<br>
  - There&#39;s a big shell hanging to the right of the gate, and a bunch of stones on the ground.<br>
  - Try putting the stones in the shell.<br>
  - Look carefully at what happens to the gate when you put a stone in the shell.<br>
  - The dial at the top of the gate moves.<br>
  - Put just enough stones in the shell to get the two blue dots on the dial to line up. The larger stones will move the dial further than the smaller stones.<br>
<br>
  Q. Where are all the villagers?<br>
  - Have you looked in all the houses?<br>
  - Have you looked underwater?<br>
  - If you go underwater, you can see a submerged hut.<br>
  - The villagers and their Turaga, Nokama, are trapped in that hut.<br>
  - You can&#39;t talk to them from down there, you&#39;ll have to find a different way.<br>
<br>
  Q. How do I rescue the villagers?<br>
  - You&#39;re a visitor to this village, but maybe one of the villagers knows what to do.<br>
  - All the villagers are trapped underwater. You&#39;ll have to figure out how to talk with them.<br>
  - There&#39;s a lily pad with a strange machine, just to the left of the hut that leads you underwater.<br>
  - If you go to this lily pad, there&#39;s a little tube at the left edge.<br>
  - If you click on the tube, you can talk with Nokama, who has some ideas on what to do.<br>
<br>
  Q. How do I repair the machine?<br>
  - Try pressing the button!<br>
  - Oops, nothing happened. Looks like something&#39;s missing in the middle there.<br>
  - You need to find the missing gear. If it&#39;s not on the machine, maybe it fell...<br>
  - ... into the water. It&#39;s on the ocean floor somewhere.<br>
  - It&#39;s pretty dark down there, but Nokama might be able to help you.<br>
  - You need Nokama&#39;s lightstone, which is in one of the huts. It will illuminate the darkness underwater.<br>
  - Once you&#39;ve found the missing gear, put it in the machine and press the button!<br>
<br>
  Q. I can&#39;t pick up the lightstone.<br>
  - It&#39;s much easier to carry stuff when you have something to carry it in.<br>
  - Look around the village.<br>
  - There&#39;s a backpack in the hut that leads underwater. Once you have the backpack you can pick up the lightstone -- not to mention other stuff you might need.<br>
<br>
  Q. I know what I&#39;m supposed to do underwater, but how do I find it?<br>
  - Gears are much shinier than ocean-dwelling plants and animals.<br>
  - Try dragging the lightstone along the ocean floor.<br>
  - The gear has fallen into a clump of sea plants and it&#39;s hard to tell which one is the gear! Shine the lightstone on the clumps of sea plants that look like they have spokes -- eventually you&#39;ll find the gear.<br>
  - The gear could be in any of the four underwater scenes. Try turning around, moving towards the sunken hut, or moving back towards the hole that leads to the surface.<br>
<br>


<b>Po-Wahi and Po-Koro</b><br>
  Q. What do I do in the dead-end valley with all the huge statues?<br>
  - Those statues look kind of familiar, don&#39;t they?<br>
  - Have you tried clicking on them?<br>
  - That slot looks like something might fit into it.<br>
  - You need a key, better look elsewhere.<br>
  - The statues are of the six Toa, each of which is associated with a particular element.<br>
  - This place is called the Quarry.<br>
<br>
  Q. How do I get to Po-Koro?<br>
  - From the shores, turn left at the first intersection, and turn right at the second intersection.<br>
<br>
  Q. What&#39;s wrong with the villagers in Po-Koro?<br>
  - Try talking to everyone, someone might know more about what&#39;s going on.<br>
  - There&#39;s a Koli player in the stadium that you might want to talk to.<br>
  - Try leaving the stadium and coming back.<br>
  - Oops, he left his Koli ball behind...<br>
  - Something&#39;s very strange about that ball. You might want to show it to Onewa.<br>
  - For that matter, you might want to find out where that ball came from.<br>
<br>
  Q. Where do Comet Koli balls come from?<br>
  - Well, there&#39;s a big marketplace in the middle of Po-Koro.<br>
  - Maybe someone&#39;s selling them.<br>
  - Talk to the merchant just to the right of the gate when you come into Po-Koro.<br>
  - Hmm, he won&#39;t tell you where he got them from. Maybe there&#39;s another clue around?<br>
  - Look near his stand for clues.<br>
  - There&#39;s an object just to the right of his stand, on the ground. It&#39;s not a Koli ball.<br>
  - Have you seen anywhere that this might fit into?<br>
  - It&#39;s a key for one of the statues in the quarry.<br>
<br>
  Q. How do I get to the Quarry?<br>
  - From Po-Koro, turn left at the first intersection, and turn left again at the second intersection.<br>
  - From the shores, turn right at the first intersection.<br>
<br>
  Q. How do I know which statue in the Quarry is the right one?<br>
  - If you have the key, there is a symbol on it.<br>
  - This symbol corresponds to one of the six elements: earth, stone, water, air, fire, or ice.<br>
  - The six elements correspond to the six Toa.<br>
  - The statues are of the Great Masks of Power that belong to each of the six Toa.<br>
  - If you&#39;re not sure which Mask goes with which Toa or which Toa goes with which element, look  at www.lego.com/bionicle/toa.asp.<br>
<br>
  Q. I&#39;ve entered the secret chamber and there&#39;s an angry Nui Jaga in there! What do I do?<br>
  - Did you see Pohatu? What did he say?<br>
  - Try to knock down the Rahi&#39;s nest with stones.<br>
  - Click on a stone, drag it until you get to supporting trunk and fire!<br>
  - Knock down all of the Rahi&#39;s support and escape with Pohatu.<br>
<br>
  Q. I&#39;ve returned to Po-Koro and everyone seems better. Now what?<br>
  - Have you talked to Onewa?<br>
  - He should give you a gift.<br>
  - Take the chisel back to Ga-Koro.<br>
  - Give the chisel to one of Ga-Koro&#39;s residents.<br>
  - You should receive another gift in exchange for the chisel from Nokama.<br>
  - The new gift is an episode book with movies from all seven stories.<br>
<br>


<b>Onu-Koro</b><br>
  Q. I&#39;m at the entrance to the cave and there are some strange creatures there. What do I do?<br>

  - Try crossing the bridge and venturing into the tunnels.<br>
<br>
  Q. I&#39;ve come to a fork in the road. Which way should I go?<br>
  - To the right is Le-Koro, to the left is Ta-Koro. You should brush up on your Bionicle language!<br>
  - Take the right fork towards Le-Koro.<br>
  - Did you run into anyone?<br>
  - Taipu is working, but its not easy without some lightstones.<br>
  - Try going back towards Ta-Koro.<br>
